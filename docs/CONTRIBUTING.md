# Contributing

First of all, thank you for your consideration for contributing to Palette Ballot! All requests and questions are greatly appreciated.

Note: Currently, this project is a work-in-progress.

## Environment

Ensure that the Gulp command is installed globally: `npm i -g gulp-cli`

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/standard/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/standard/standard)

Make sure that you have the [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/#are-there-text-editor-plugins) and [Editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) plugins installed for your respective text editors!

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are always welcomed!
It doesn't necessarily need to be code for the application itself -- it could even be as little as fixing a typo in the docs and comments. Just make sure that they are relatively clean submissions with nice, descriptive comments and commit messages.

## Issues

Issues can be either reporting some errors or suggesting new features! Like pull requests, please be descriptive. More details for each listed below.

### Bug Reports

In bug report issues, please list what happened and where it happened when the bug appeared.
Each bug will be marked with a priority: minor, medium, major, and critical.

### Feature Requests / Suggestions

As the project grows and hopefully stays around for a while, new feature ideas will be happily reviewed and considered for implementation!
There can also be suggestions for other stuff -- like adding another option or resizing some sections.

## One More Thing

This project is meant to make things a bit easier for digital artists, designers, and anyone else using color palettes!
It is very well encouraged to send feedback and **constructive** criticisms of design choices.

Once again, thank you for your consideration and I wish the best for your own projects!
